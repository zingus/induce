# Induce

Induce is a pretty interesting library for php, it actually implements what is
commonly called "reverse-regex expansion", but is actually induction. It isn't
really ready to be imported in composer now, but I'll eventually get around to
put it in shape for that purpose.

If you're interested in it and you wish I wrote some documentation, examples, and
allowed autoloading it... please let me know via the [issue tracker][issues].
